Text-Similarity-Analysis-with-Sentence-Embeddings-and-TOPSIS-Ranking
This project aims to explore text similarity using sentence embeddings from popular language models, including BERT, USE, Tf-Idf, RoBERTa, and XLNet. The goal is to evaluate their performance and select the optimal model using TOPSIS ranking. This serves as a practical application for measuring sentence similarity and choosing the most effective language model for your specific use case.

Dependencies
Python 3.x
Scikit-learn
Sentence Transformers
NumPy
Pandas
Results
Explore the cosine similarity table generated for different language models and witness the TOPSIS ranking results, helping you choose the most effective model for your text similarity tasks.
